# 1.Introduction 

This document provides a procedure to train an CDCN model to detect liveness from images.

# 2. Preparing the enviroment 

## 2.1.Get and install CDCN
Create a main folder for project:
	
	mkdir CDCN-Model 

Download:  
	
	cd CDCN-Model 
	git clone https://github.com/ZitongYu/CDCN.git
    
 
## 2.2 Create a folder for Python virtual environments 
### 2.2.1.Download python3.8 -venv to create environment:
You must be in  ../CDCN-Model folder.   
   
   	sudo apt install python3.8-venv
    
### 2.2.2.Create python environment

	python3 -m venv cdcn-env

### 2.2.3.Activate python environment
 
    source cdcn-env/bin/activate

    
# 3.Install essential packages that will be used by CDCN building

Install required packages:

	pip3 --no-cache-dir install torchvision
	pip install matplotlib
	pip3 --no-cache-dir install pandas
	pip install scikit-build
	pip install opencv-python
	pip install imgaug
	pip --no-cache-dir install sklearn

You can install all required packages with following command.

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	
# 4. Building 
## 4.1. Fix Bugs 
- First of all, this repository have an indentation error in line 242 of /CDCN/CVPR2020_paper_codes/
train_CDCN.py file. We must fix that problem.
- Secondly, line 246 is "model = model.cuda()" in train_CDCN.py file and we changed to be comment line this line and add the following are to force CPU to be used  :
	 	
		device=torch.device("cpu")
        	
		model.to(device)
	
- Finally, add following codes to line 203
	
		os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]=""
		
## 4.2. Building Training File 

	cd CDCN/CVPR2020_paper_codes
	python3 train_CDCN.py

# 5. Create Map Images
In this step, we realize that we need map_images, so we will create mapped images from our dataset. We will use repository of PRNet-Depth-Generation to generate mapped images.

## 5.1. Preparing the enviroment

### 5.1.1 Get and install PRNet-Depth-Generation
Create a main folder for project:
	
	mkdir PRNet-Map-Images-Generation 

Download:  
	
	cd PRNet-Map-Images-Generation 
	git clone https://github.com/clks-wzz/PRNet-Depth-Generation.git
	
### 5.1.2 Create a folder for Python virtual environments 
#### 5.1.2.1. Download python3.8 -venv to create environment:
You must be in  ./PRNet-Map-Images-Generation folder.   
   
   	sudo apt install python3.8-venv
    
#### 5.1.2.2. Create python environment

	python3 -m venv prnet-env

### 5.1.2.3 Activate python environment
 
    source prnet-env/bin/activate

    
## 5.2. Install essential packages that will be used by PRNet-Depth-Generation building

Install required packages:

	pip install numpy
	pip install scikit-image
	pip install scipy
	pip install opencv-python

You can install all required packages with following command.

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	
## 5.3. Building
	
	cd PRNet-Map-Images-Generation/PRNet-Depth-Generation
	python3 Generate_Depth_Image.py

NOTE: In this, spot we have some errors about building.
